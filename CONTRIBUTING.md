How To Contribute
=================

DisOAuth is a small project, but I will need help to make it into a useful project.

Bug Reporting
-------------

If you find a bug, open an issue using the bug template and give it a relevant name

If you want you can open a PR to help solve the problem. Make sure to check out the PR section

Pull Requests
-------------

Bug fixes, new features, and deprecation, all need to be merged with `main` to put it into the next version. 

Here are some rules for PR's:

- Set the title of the PR to an appropriate and related title
- Make sure to clearly state what the point of the merge is. Ex. "Fix an error in issue #1"

Try to use `pytest` or test it personally

Code Conventions
----------------

When writing patches and new functions, you must always consider at least one thing, `Readability Counts`


- Naming conventions, all described in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles)

  - Classes - Use the `lowercase` convention, and shorten the name to one word, or if necessary to an acronym
  - Functions - Use the `mixedCase` convention. I recommend trying to make the name shorter, but it isn't necessary 
  - Variables - Use the `mixedCase` convention
  - Module-level Constants - Use the `lower_case_with_underscores` convention
 
- For anything else, try to follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) generally
