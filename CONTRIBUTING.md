How To Contribute
=================

DisOAuth is a small project, but I will need help to make it into a useful project.

Useful Links:

- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org)
- [Discord Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
- [Sphinx Documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html)
- [Requests Documentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Source Guidelines
-----------------

Naming Conventions:
- When naming a constant use `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` mentioned in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles), and when naming a variable, function, class, or method use `mixedCase`, also mentioned in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles)
- When naming a module use `lowercase` and either use one word or, if you must, use an acronym

Documentation
-------------

Whether it be a typo fix or a whole new tutorial, contributions to documentation would be incredibly helpful

Since I use Sphinx and Readthedocs for documentation, having an understanding in one or both platforms is required. I also use the [furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) theme for Sphinx, so it's recommended you have an understanding for that as well
