# DiscordOAuth2
automatically follows through with the requests for Discord OAuth

***

## Features
- Makes a Authorization Url automatically, using the client ID, redirect_uri, and the scopes you want
- Nothing else, working on getting the json data from the query string

***

## What I'm working on for version 1.0.0

- [ ] Making the request function to get the json data returned after authorization
  - [ ] ~~Make a new class that retrieves the query string (for both synchronous and asynchronous projects)~~
  - [ ] Make two seperate classes, synchronous and asynchronous,
    - [ ] Test (Version 0.2.0)
    - [ ] [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
